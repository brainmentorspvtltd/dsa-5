Java
- Platform Independent
  - WORA - Write Once Run Anywhere
- High level
- Open Source - till java 11
- OOPS (not fully object oriented)

class Calc  {
	int x,y;
	int add() {
		return x + y;
	}

	int sub() {
		return x - y;
	}

}


3 major type of programming :
- procedural - Functions - Divide a problem into functions
- oops - wrap all the variables and functions into a single unit
- functional - python, javascript

Setup Java
JDK
- Java Compiler
- javadoc (java documentation)
- jar - java archive

Java Installation
1. Download Java 11
2. Set path in environment variable
3. Copy path till bin folder and paste in envrionment variable

VS Code - Editor
Eclipse - IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

Java SE - Standard Edition
Java EE - Enterprise Edition

Creating first program in java
- Every java prpgram start with class
- Class name should start with capital letter
- Class name should be same as file name
- Class name starts with either alphabet or special symbol(_, $)

javac ClassName.java
- compile the code

java ClassName
- execute the code

javac comes from JDK 
java  comes from JRE, Now JRE starts searching for main


Main method
- Entry point of any program
- without main java will compile the code and convert it into byte code, but it cannot execute the code or interpret the code


public - global, which is accessible for all, from anywhere
private - accessible within the class only
protected - can be accessed inside the package, can also be accessed outisde the package by using inheritance.
default - it's not a reserved keyword, if you will not specify any scope then it is default. The scope can be accessed by any class but within same package


Why main is public ?
- JRE uses main : java <ByteCode>
- Java command triggers JRE
- JRE starts searching for main method
- JRE load our class into memory
- JRE is outside our code directory.

Why Static ?
- Static things are loaded into memory when class is loaded.

Why void ?
- main return nothing, because main is entry point.

Main arguments - String args[]
- we can make our own commands
- we can pass any number of arguments, that's why it is array
- data type of command line arguments could be anything, so it convert all the arguments to one single type, i.e., string


System.out.println
- println - print in new line, println comes from out object
- out - out is an object, which belongs to PrintStream class
- System is a class used for input, output and error
  - System.in, System.out, System.err

Local variables must be initialised before use

java ClassName 10
java ClassName 10 20
java ClassName 10 30 40 50
java ClassName 10 90 12 12 34 56 67


Why java is slow ?

2 phases of JVM
- loading
  - Bootstrap Classloader
  - Extension ClassLoader
- linking
  - Verify
  - prepare

rt.jar

Dynamic class loading - ClassLoader subsystem

Dynamic linking
Run-time interpreter
