POJO - Plain Old Java Object
SRP
DRY

Getter and Setter

primary - never changing variables
secondary - change in future...

Relationships
- IS-A (Inheritance)
- HAS-A (communicating with class by making object in another class)

1. no reusability in code
2. polymorphism

Polymorphism
- one thing having several form
- creating function with same name but each function perform different task

- Why create function with same name ?

- if we don't want the functionality of parents function than create the function with same, then it will hide parent's functionality

Overriding is example of polymorphism,
but overriding is only possiblw when there is inheritance

Overloading is performed when we pass argument
Overriding means to update the parent's method


Polymorphic

Upcasting - means to cast yourself up, means only upper features will work

Downcasting

final
- class
- method
- variable

super vs this
overriding rules
overloading rules
