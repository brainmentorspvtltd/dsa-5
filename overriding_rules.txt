I18N

1. create new file with .properties extension

super vs this
override method vs variables
 - methods are always bind with objects
 - variables are always bind with class type
multilevel hierarchy



Overriding rules
1. Weaker access rule
  - to update feature
  - method signature must be same
how to change method signature...
 - scope - private, default, protected, public
 - packages - collection of similar classes - modularity
	- com (commercial)
	- org (organization)
	com.companyName.ProjectName.Module.SubModule

I want access the member variables of a class outside the package, and those variables should not be public, then what is the procedure ?
- make member variables protected and inherit the particular where you want to access those variables...

private < default < protected < public


2. Covariant return type rule
