Data Types
- Primitive
- Non-primitive (Reference data type)

1. primitive are pre-defined, non-primitive are user defined
2. primitive can store only single value, non-primitive can store value
3. non-primitive are generally derived from primitive
4. primitive have fixed memory size, non-primitive has dynamic memory allocation

- primitive cannot store null, non-primitve can be null
- primitive do not have any methods, non-primitive has methods
- primitive do not have any references, non-primitive has references


Integers
- byte  - 1 byte
- short - 2 bytes
- int   - 4 bytes
- long  - 8 bytes

Enter the age : byte
1 byte = 8 bit
1 bit +, -
-2 ^ 7 to 2 ^ 7 - 1
-128 to 127

Use of bytes data type
- small range of values
- Networking
- File Handling

For decimal we have :
- Float
- Double

strictfp

Char - 2byte
- hold only single character


Taking Input in Java

System.in - works like a channel
System.out
System.err

Scanner
- is a buffer
- will collect buffered input
